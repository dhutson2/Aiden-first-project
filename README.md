# Aiden-first-project

GoDot is open source so you should just be able to  download it on whichever OS he will be using at home.

Just take the files here, save them in a folder called Aidens project (or some other name), and then launch GoDot.
Then on the projects screen, click "import" and select the folder.
This should open up his project so that he can then start playing around with it!
